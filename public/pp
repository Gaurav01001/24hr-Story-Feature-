////////////
\Next steps will be:

Load stories from localStorage

Filter expired stories

Persist updates

Add addStory()
///////////////////
AddStoryButton  →  App.jsx  →  ImageUploader  →  useStories
        (File)        (File)        (base64)
ImageUploader should:

receive a File

process it

call onComplete(base64)

That’s it.[file] → ImageUploader → (base64) → callback

STEP 1 → useStories.js

👉 Change the data model from a flat stories[] to storyGroups[], so one circle can contain multiple stories.

STEP 2 → useStories.js

👉 Update addStory() so new stories are added to an existing group (or a new group), instead of creating a new circle every time.

STEP 3 → App.jsx

👉 Replace activeIndex with two indices: activeGroupIndex and activeStoryIndex to support nested navigation.

STEP 4 → App.jsx

👉 Update navigation logic so nextStory() first moves within a group, then moves to the next group, and finally closes the viewer.

STEP 5 → StoriesBar.jsx

👉 Render one circle per story group, not per individual story, and open the first story of that group on click.

STEP 6 → StoryViewer.jsx

👉 Read the currently active story using both indices (groupIndex + storyIndex) and display the correct image.

STEP 7 → StoryViewer.jsx

👉 Update progress completion behavior so it advances to the next story inside the group, not immediately to the next circle.

STEP 8 → StoryProgress.jsx

👉 No logic changes — reuse it as-is, now scoped to the current story segment.

STEP 9 → viewer.css

👉 Add support for multiple progress segments (one per story inside a group) for Instagram-style segmented bars.

STEP 10 → StoriesBar.css

👉 Add seen/unseen ring logic so a circle shows as “seen” only after all stories in that group are viewed.
