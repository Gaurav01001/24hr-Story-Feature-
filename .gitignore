🧠 Purpose of useStories.js

useStories.js is a custom React Hook.

In simple terms:

It is the single source of truth for all story-related logic.

Your UI components must NOT:

Talk directly to localStorage

Handle time calculations

Know when stories expire

Mutate story data

All of that belongs here.

🎯 What Problems useStories.js Solves
1️⃣ Centralized State

Holds the stories array

Prevents duplicate logic across components

2️⃣ 24-Hour Expiry Logic

Automatically removes expired stories

Ensures consistency on every app reload

3️⃣ LocalStorage Sync

Reads once on load

Writes on every update

4️⃣ Clean API for UI ->addStory(image)
removeStory(id)
